## How It Works:

- **Browse:** Select the folders where your ROMs and cover images are stored.

- **List:** It will list which cover images are missing for your ROM collection.

- **Match:** The app will search within the Cover Image folder for an image with a similar filename. Adjust the similarity threshold to find the best matches.

- **Display:** Displays suggestions for cover images on the right panel for the selected ROM. You can adjust the size of the image previews.

- **Organize:** Manually select the best cover images from the suggestions provided.

- **Copy:** Click on the image to copy it to the Cover Image folder, renaming the image to match the ROM file name.


## Features:

- **Easy ROM and Cover Image Matching:** Automatically matches your ROM files with their corresponding cover images based on name similarity.

- **Adjustable Similarity Threshold:** Fine-tune how strict the matching criteria should be. Whether you prefer exact matches or broader suggestions, you have the control.

- **Thumbnail Size Customization:** Choose how large or small you want the cover image thumbnails to appear, making it easier to view and select the right covers.

- **Manual Selection:** Browse through suggested images and pick the perfect cover for each ROM, ensuring your collection looks exactly how you want it.

- **Missing Image Finder:** Quickly identify which ROMs are missing cover images, helping you complete your collection.

- **Simple Interface:** Designed for ease of use, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of tech-savviness.
