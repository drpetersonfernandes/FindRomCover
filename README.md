## How It Works:

-   **Browse:** Select the folders where your ROMs and cover images are stored.
-   **Command-line Support:** Optionally launch the application with ROM and Image folder paths provided as arguments.
-   **List:** It will list which cover images are missing for your ROM collection.
-   **Match:** The app will search within the Cover Image folder for an image with a similar filename using a configurable similarity algorithm. Adjust the similarity threshold to find the best matches.
-   **Display:** Displays suggestions for cover images on the right panel for the selected ROM, along with their calculated similarity percentage. You can adjust the size of the image previews.
-   **Organize:** Manually select the best cover images from the suggestions provided.
-   **Copy:** Click on an image or use the right-click context menu ("Use This Image") to copy it to the Cover Image folder, renaming the image to match the ROM filename and converting it to PNG format. The context menu also provides options to copy the image filename or open its location in File Explorer.
